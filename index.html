        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
          In a blender, stir the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar and cocoa powder until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, add the flour and baking powder and mix with a spoon. Pour into cupcake molds lined with paper liners and place them on a large baking sheet, one next to the other. Bake in a preheated medium oven for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove and let cool.
          <br><br>
          For the filling, heat all the ingredients over medium heat, stirring well until thickened. Turn off the heat, let it cool and place in a piping bag with a pearl tip. Set aside. Place the whipped cream in a piping bag with a star tip and set aside.
          <br><br>
          To assemble, make a hole in the center of the cupcakes and fill with the reserved coffee brigadeiro. Decorate the surfaces of the cupcakes with the reserved whipped cream, making circles. Decorate with coffee beans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
